üñ•Ô∏è Task 04 ‚Äì Keylogger (Python-Based)
Objective:
Develop a Python program that captures and logs keystrokes, simulating basic keystroke monitoring behavior for educational and ethical testing purposes.

Key Features:

Captures every key press (letters, digits, special characters)

Logs input to a .txt file in real-time

Handles both character and special keys (e.g., [ENTER], [SPACE])

Runs continuously in the background until manually stopped

Skills Demonstrated:

Event-driven programming using pynput

File handling for real-time logging

Handling exceptions for special keys

Understanding ethical boundaries of monitoring tools

Purpose:
This task helped me explore how input events can be captured in Python, reinforcing concepts related to keyboard listeners, user interaction logging, and responsible coding practices in cybersecurity.
